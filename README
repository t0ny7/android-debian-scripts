I hold no responsibility if these scripts damage your phone, cat, dog or any other device. 

Currently these script are here for people who know what they are doing. I will make it easier and write more documentation soon.

At the beginning of these scripts there are two variable you need to change before using. mnt is where you want your Debian environment mounted. On my phone /sdcard is linked to /mnt/sdcard so I need to use /mnt/sdcard. img is where your image is.

start-deb.sh starts your Debian environment.

stop-deb.sh stops your Debian environment. You need to manually stop any process that in running so that it can unmount the image. This will be automatic in the future.

deb-shell.sh Takes you to a shell.

TODO:
* Have stop-deb.sh detect running process in the Debian environment and kill them so it can unmount the image.
